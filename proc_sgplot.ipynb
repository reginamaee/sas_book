    "# PROC SGPLOT\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we explored creating bar graphs within a `proc freq` step. However, this approach offers limited customization options. By using a different procedure, `proc sgplot`, we can easily produce a wide range of high-quality statistical graphics with greater flexibility and layering options. This procedure is commonly used to generate scatter plots, bar charts, line plots, histograms, box plots, and more. It is part of the SAS ODS Graphics system, which allows users to visualize data effectively for analysis and reporting."
